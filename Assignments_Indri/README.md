# Parallel Programming - Assignments
This folder contains the exercises for the Parallel Programming course at UniTS. The exercises are organised into *Assignment* folders, and for each assignment a report is provided.

## Reproducibility
Each exercise contains a `run.sh` script to compile and run the code; the scripts are meant to be used on Ulysses. The reports provide more details.
